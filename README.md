### 5.	Features / Highlights

####	Business Problem

The coffee shop lacked clear visibility into its sales trends, product performance, and customer traffic.
Management struggled to identify peak hours, top-selling items, and weekday vs weekend revenue patterns.
Without data-driven insights, staff scheduling and inventory planning were inefficient.
A Power BI dashboard was needed to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence.



#### Goal of the Dashboard

The goal of this dashboard is to provide clear visibility into coffee shop sales and customer behavior.
It helps track revenue trends, product performance, and peak operating hours in real time.
Managers can make data-driven decisions for staffing, inventory, and promotional strategies.

#### Walkthrough of Key Visuals
Top KPI row — Total Sales: $9K (▲ +34.9% | + $2.3K vs Last Month). Total orders in the month: 267. Total traffic / sessions: 128.

Trend sparklines and mini charts — Each KPI has a sparkline showing day-to-day movement across the selected month (the screenshot shows May 2024). The sales sparkline confirms recent upward momentum.

Total sales by date — Bar chart with a dashed line showing average sales ≈ $324 per date. Bars show daily variation across the month with several peak days (visible tall bars around mid- and late-May).

Sales by weekday / weekend — Donut/KPI shows weekdays contribute ~77.4% ($7K) of sales while weekend ~22.6% ($2K). This tells us the bulk of revenue is weekday-driven.

Unit sales in month — Donut chart of item counts by product (slices for Latte, Cappuccino, Americano, Cortado, etc.). Gives quick view of quantity share.

Product sales (horizontal bars) — Top products by revenue: Latte ≈ $2.2K, Cappuccino ≈ $2.1K, Americano ≈ $1.9K, others lower (Espresso ≈ $0.2K). This identifies top revenue drivers.

Sales by day & hour (heatmap) — A color-coded heat map showing sales intensity by hour (rows) and day of week (columns). Darker cells indicate higher sales — peaks are concentrated in morning/late-morning and some afternoon hours on specific weekdays.

Right-side ranked bars — Additional ranked totals (likely by product, day or hour) showing distribution of revenue across categories.

Filter panel / Slicers — Month selector and an interactive calendar allow quick time filtering. Product and other slicers (not all visible) appear available.

Tooltips & detail pages — The design indicates tooltips(e.g., hovring on bar should show order-level details in the tooltip or a separate tooltip page).

####	Business Impact & Insights

Company-level performance: The month shows $9K in sales with strong growth vs last month (+34.9% / +$2.3K). That's a meaningful month-over-month improvement.

Orders vs Traffic: 267 orders from 128 traffic suggests multiple orders per visiting session or a tracking mismatch—investigate definition of "traffic" (unique visitors vs sessions vs app visits).

Product mix: Latte and Cappuccino are the top revenue contributors (~$2.2K and ~$2.1K). Consider prioritizing inventory and promotions for those items.

Timing: Weekdays are far more important (≈77% of sales). Peak hours cluster around later-morning and early-afternoon — ideal times for staff scheduling and promotions.

Average per-day: Average daily sales line shows ~$324 — can be used as a baseline for forecasting and variance analysis.
